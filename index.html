As a team lead of 8 developers we managed to create two applications (Android app and web app). The application/s were a candidate management system that would help in taking candidates attendance. The android app was built using Java on Android studio. It involved the usage of 3rd party APIs and we used the Agile methology. We also made a web app to work along with the android application with it's backend built on php. With a team of 4 developers we managed to refactor and maintain the BASF quality web application using ASP.NET MVC. I was involved in creating external 3rd party authentication (Facebook and google) using Rest API's. I got a chance to work with Microsoft SQL Server(using entity framework) as a database and used C# in the controllers connecting the frontend to the database. In building the frontend, I got a chance to use jQuery, Bootstrap, Razor, CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript. This web app was built to assist BASF employees in managing the high loads of customer related data. I participated in writing a documentation for the application, which also helped in improving my technical writing skills. For deployment of the application we used Azure

                    2021 Post lockdown Hackathon(June 2021) 3rd prize winner(Younglings Africa) for building a flutter mobile e-learning application in 2 weeks. The application involved the usage of AI, making a voice recognition application that can take commands from the end users to help them learn and use the app better (using Alan studio), I also got a chance to build a many-to-many chat application using cloud firestore to create a chat room/s for users to share study content.This application also had awesome features like ocr to help in the conversion of written text to digital text. Users were able to share all types of media files (images, videos, music, docx, csv etc.
                    
                    <br/><br/> I got a chance to build a location based login system in reactjs. This web app allowed users who are registered on the app to only be able to login from specific latitude and longitude coordinates. This web required the usage of trigonometry and a lot of mathematical concepts. I got to work with balsamiq in making the wireframes, Adobe XD for the design and reactjs for the development. I also got a chance to migrate an old Angularjs project to Angular. This involved the configuration of Webpack and NPM from Gulp/Grunt and bower components. This was to make sure that the web app is well maintained. <br/><br/>
                    
                    I also got a chance to mentor a group of 6 developers, who really helped me improve my leadership skills.

I'm the lead in the front end of all these applications. I got a chance to work with Rest and SOAP Api's created using AWS lambda functions (dynamoDb). For the flutter application's we used firebase to create a backend as a service for the authentication. In the react web app I had a chance to work with redux, react routing, material UI. All of these apps designs were done using figma. The kotlin application was for a barcode generating and scanner device, which also had the integration of APIs from companies in partnership with the laboratory. <br/> <br/>  
                        All of these were built using the microservice architecture approach. Trello &slack was the colaborative the environment we used
